## HiAnime Ad Blocker
This Ad Blocker auto detects redirect URL links and auto closes tabs.


# Goal:

## The goal is to be able to watch HiAnime without unknown links or unwanted links pop-ups.
Everyone can agree it's annyoing. As I keep updating the background.js
to auto close random redirects links it doesn't distract me as much as it used to without
a Ad blocker so I created one specifically for ( HiAnime ).
