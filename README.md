## Goal

The goal is to watch HiAnime without unwanted ads or pop-ups.

## Features:

- Auto Tab Closing: Detects and closes redirect pop-up tabs to prevent interruptions.
  
- Customizable Allowed Domains: Maintains a list of allowed domains (e.g., discord.com, github.com) to prevent unnecessary blocking on trusted sites.
  
- Ad Blocking Rules: Blocks various ad resources (scripts, images, etc.) from known ad domains, enhancing load times and privacy.
  
- Hide Pop-ups and Overlays: Conceals overlays, modals, and banners commonly used for ads.
  
- URL Monitoring: Monitors page changes (hash change, popstate) and DOM mutations to detect and block ads dynamically.
  
- Multi-Browser Compatibility: Primarily designed for Chrome, Opera, and other


## Bug Fixes:

- Fixed an issue where some tabs were closed incorrectly due to misidentification of allowed domains.
  
- Resolved a bug causing errors when detecting certain URL mutations.
  
- Fixed minor UI issues for console logging, making it easier to trace blocked tabs and allowed sites.
